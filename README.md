## 🗺️ Store Locator Integration

Integrated functionality that fetches, transforms, and upserts a flat array of dealer objects to the `woood.store_locator` shop metafield from the external Dutch Furniture Fulfillment API.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled (cron) and manual sync triggers via `/api/store-locator/trigger`
- Data transformation and filtering (active/activated dealers, mapped exclusives, sensitive fields removed)
- Upserts to Shopify shop metafield using Admin API credentials
- Output is a flat array of dealer objects (not nested)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Status tracking via `/api/store-locator/status`

**External API Integration:**
- **Endpoint**: `https://portal.dutchfurniturefulfilment.nl/api/datasource/wooodshopfinder`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` environment variable

**Example Use Case:**
Keep your store locator data in sync for theme/app blocks, with zero manual intervention.

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for full details and transformation rules.

## 🏪 Experience Center Integration

Integrated functionality that queries the external Dutch Furniture Fulfillment API and sets the `woood.experiencecenter` boolean metafield for products based on their availability in the external system.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled (cron) and manual sync triggers via `/api/experience-center/trigger`
- EAN code mapping from product metafields to external API data
- Batch processing for efficient updates
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Status tracking via `/api/experience-center/status`

**External API Integration:**
- **Endpoint**: `https://portal.dutchfurniturefulfilment.nl/api/productAvailability/query?fields=ean&fields=channel&fields=itemcode`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `DUTCH_FURNITURE_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Data Structure**: Array of product availability objects with EAN, channel, and itemcode

**Example Use Case:**
Automatically mark products as available in experience centers based on external inventory data.
