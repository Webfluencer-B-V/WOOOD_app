## 🗺️ Store Locator Upserter Worker

A dedicated Cloudflare Worker (`workers/store-locator/`) that fetches, transforms, and upserts a flat array of dealer objects to the `woood.store_locator` shop metafield from an external API.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled (cron) and manual upsert triggers
- Data transformation and filtering (active/activated dealers, mapped exclusives, sensitive fields removed)
- Upserts to Shopify shop metafield using Admin API credentials
- Output is a flat array of dealer objects (not nested)
- Fully integrated into the app

**Example Use Case:**
Keep your store locator data in sync for theme/app blocks, with zero manual intervention.

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for full details and transformation rules.
