## ✨ What it does

- Checkout extensions for delivery date selection powered by DutchNed logistics
- Admin dashboard (Polaris) for system status, store locator, and experience center
- Cloudflare Worker backend with D1 (SQL) and KV (legacy) integrations
- Webhook pipeline from checkout to order metafields

## ✅ Current Production Status

**EXTENSION + WORKERS ARCHITECTURE** - Streamlined system operational:

- ✅ **Checkout Extensions**: Active delivery date picker and shipping method processing
- ✅ **Workers API**: All endpoints returning correct data with <50ms response times
- ✅ **OAuth Authentication**: Simple token-based authentication system
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Automated order processing (note_attributes → metafields)
- ✅ **Production Deployment**: `delivery-date-picker.workers.dev`

### Recent Architecture Simplification
- ✅ **Extension-Only Model**: Removed complex admin UI for streamlined deployment
- ✅ **Simple Token Storage**: Eliminated session system complexity for <10% CPU usage
- ✅ **Unified Configuration**: Single `wrangler.toml` configuration file
- ✅ **Native Platform Patterns**: Using Cloudflare Workers and Shopify Extensions native configs

## 🎯 What This System Does

1. **📅 Delivery Date Selection** - Customers select delivery dates in Shopify checkout based on real DutchNed availability
2. **🚚 Smart Shipping Methods** - Dynamic shipping options filtered by product requirements via checkout extensions
3. **⚡ Global Performance** - <50ms response times via Cloudflare's 300+ edge locations
4. **🔄 Automated Order Processing** - Complete webhook-driven pipeline (checkout → Workers → metafields)
5. **🔐 Simple Security** - OAuth 2.0 with lightweight token storage and HMAC webhook validation

## 🔧 Extension Configuration

### Simplified Settings (Merchant Configurable)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Extension Mode** | `Full` | Controls extension behavior: Disabled (off), Shipping Data Only (metadata only), Date Picker Only (picker only), Full (complete functionality) |
| **Delivery Method Cutoff** | `30` | Shipping methods >= this number use Dutchned API (live dates), < this number use POST mock data |
| **Date Picker Filtering** | `ERP Filtered` | No Filtering: Show all available dates \| ERP Filtered: Only show dates after product minimum delivery times |
| **Hide Picker Within Days** | `14` | Hide date picker if products can be delivered within this many days (0 = always show picker) |
| **Max Dates to Show** | `15` | Maximum number of delivery dates to display in the picker |
| **Active Country Codes** | `NL` | Comma-separated country codes where date picker is active (e.g., NL,BE,DE) |
| **Enable Mock Dates** | `false` | Enable mock delivery dates for testing (fallback when API is unavailable) |
| **Preview Mode** | `false` | Show preview-only UI with debug information (for testing in Checkout Editor) |

### Built-in Features (Always Active)
- ✅ **Inventory Check**: Real-time stock verification from Shopify Admin API (always enabled)
- ✅ **CORS Security**: Proper cross-origin headers for secure API communication
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when APIs fail (customer-friendly)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging and flow visibility

## 📊 Three-Step Decision Flow

The extension follows a clear three-step decision process to determine delivery dates:

### Step 1: Stock Check 📦
- **Fetches real inventory** from Shopify Admin API
- **If any product is out of stock** → ERP delivery (no date picker)
- **If all products in stock** → Continue to shipping method check

### Step 2: Shipping Method Analysis 🚚
- **Extracts number** from shipping method name (e.g., "35 - EXPEDITIE STANDAARD" → 35)
- **Compares with cutoff** (default: 30)
- **≥ 30 = DUTCHNED delivery** (live API dates)
- **< 30 = POST delivery** (mock dates)

### Step 3: Date Source & Filtering 📅
- **ERP**: No date picker shown, ERP system determines delivery
- **DUTCHNED**: Live API dates from Dutchned service (max 14 dates)
- **POST**: Generated mock dates (max 15 dates)
- **Optional ERP Filtering**: Only show dates ≥ product minimum delivery date

Integrated functionality that fetches, transforms, and upserts a flat array of dealer objects to the `woood.store_locator` shop metafield from the external Dutch Furniture Fulfillment API.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled (cron) and manual sync triggers via `/api/store-locator/trigger`
- Data transformation and filtering (active/activated dealers, mapped exclusives, sensitive fields removed)
- Upserts to Shopify shop metafield using Admin API credentials
- Output is a flat array of dealer objects (not nested)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Status tracking via `/api/store-locator/status`

**External API Integration:**
- **Endpoint**: `https://portal.dutchfurniturefulfilment.nl/api/datasource/wooodshopfinder`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` environment variable

**Example Use Case:**
Keep your store locator data in sync for theme/app blocks, with zero manual intervention.

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for full details and transformation rules.

## 🏪 Experience Center Integration

Integrated functionality that queries the external Dutch Furniture Fulfillment API and sets the `woood.experiencecenter` boolean metafield for products based on their availability in the external system.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled (cron) and manual sync triggers via `/api/experience-center/trigger`
- EAN code mapping from product metafields to external API data
- Batch processing for efficient updates
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Status tracking via `/api/experience-center/status`

**External API Integration:**
