- [x] **Error Handling & Logging**: Robust error handling and logging for all steps
- [x] **Consolidated Architecture**: Integrated into main worker for simplified deployment

**Transformation/Filtering Rules:**
- Only include dealers where `accountStatus === 'A'` and `dealerActivationPortal === true` or `'WAAR'`
- Map `nameAlias` to `name` (fallback to `name` if missing)
- Map exclusivity fields (`Exclusiviteit`, `shopfinderExclusives`, `ShopfinderExclusives`) using predefined mapping logic
- Remove sensitive fields (e.g., `accountmanager`, `dealerActivationPortal`, `vatNumber`, `shopfinderExclusives`, `accountStatus`)
- **Output JSON structure:** a flat array of dealer objects, with all fields on the root object (not nested under any wrapper)

**Exclusivity Mapping:**
```javascript
const EXCLUSIVITY_MAP = {
  'woood essentials': 'WOOOD ESSENTIALS',
  'essentials': 'WOOOD ESSENTIALS',
  'woood premium': 'WOOOD PREMIUM',
  'woood exclusive': 'WOOOD PREMIUM',
  'woood outdoor': 'WOOOD OUTDOOR',
  'woood tablo': 'WOOOD TABLO',
  'vtwonen': 'VT WONEN',
  'vt wonen dealers only': 'VT WONEN',
};
```

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/store-locator/upsert` — Triggers the fetch, transform, and upsert process manually
- `GET /api/store-locator/status` — Returns the last upsert status and timestamp
- **Scheduled Cron** — Runs daily at 04:00 UTC

**Example Use Case:**
Automatically syncs a dealer/store locator JSON blob to a shop metafield for use in theme/app blocks, with full control over data mapping and update frequency.

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Shop metafields always reflect the latest external data, with minimal manual intervention and full auditability.

**Implementation:** This functionality is integrated into the main worker (`workers/src/index.ts`) with comprehensive logging and error handling.

## 🧹 LEGACY API REMOVAL PLAN

### Complete Product API Removal (Sprint 18 Target)
These endpoints are no longer needed since extensions now use native `useAppMetafields`:

```
/api/products/data                  → REMOVED (replaced by useAppMetafields)
/api/products/erp-delivery-times    → REMOVED (replaced by useAppMetafields)
/api/products/shipping-methods      → REMOVED (replaced by useAppMetafields)
```

### Native Metafield Access Benefits
- **Zero External API Calls**: Product metafields accessed directly in checkout context
- **Better Performance**: No network requests for metafield data
- **Improved Reliability**: No dependency on Workers for product data
